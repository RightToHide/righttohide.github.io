	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>How many people</i> follow your every move? Perhaps an image straight from George Orwell's worst nightmares would not be too much of an exaggeration for the state of anonymity and privacy, and yet the internet is used by billions of people daily who seem to be completely unaware of their own personal stalkers. Web beacons, cookies, browser fingerprints; these are the breadcrumbs that individuals leave as they crawl their way across page after page. And these hints, when compiled, make you, and yes, you individually and uniquely, stand out like a bright light against everyone else on the internet, prime for the tracking by any number of companies and individuals who want to find out what makes you, you. Because we are living on the very edge of a new era, we are blind to the many consequences of our actions, and must therefore take a critical look at where our society is today, how it got here, and where we might be going in the near and far future.
	<br><br>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just about every object on the internet, be it emails, texts, cat pictures, or secret government documents, has some amount of metadata attached to it. Metadata are the labels describing an object: what type of object it is, who it is from, who it is to, when and where it was created, and countless other descriptors necessary to move and use the object across the internet. These labels are usually seen as harmless because they do not explicitly reveal any information about the contents of the object. As such, they are not subject to the same level of privacy and security (and, in fact, they can't be, or metadata would not work the way they are supposed to). However, metadata does implicitly reveal the nature of every object. It implies the answers to the who's, why's, and how's of every interaction online, and corporations, governments, or malicious hackers are all to keen on inferring these answers by any means necessary. In large enough bulk, these metadata form a complete picture of social networks and personal details about people where the specifics of the contents of the documents become irrelevant, or worse, obsolete, because the contents can be inferred with high enough accuracy. At the end of the day, nobody needs to read your emails to know exactly what you are doing.<sup id="citationOne">1</sup>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team of students and professors from MIT created a website called &ldquo;Immersion&rdquo; to demonstrate the clairvoyant nature of metadata.<sup id="citationTwo">2</sup> By scanning nothing more than the to and from fields of an email, along with th timestamp, Immersion is able to create a visual graph of your correspondence that changes over time, revealing relationships and how those relationships change over time. And that is just from voluntarily surrendered information to MIT; what picture does the NSA have of you from the thousands of secretly extracted pieces of metadata they have scooped up?

					<div class="row">
						<p>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>A world of surveillance</i> doesn't appear instantaneously, though. It all began at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the late 1950's. There, a revolution was taking place: the Hacker Revolution. But unlike the technology mega&ndash;companies of today, these hackers were genuine in their love for computer science and their concern for the average person. They hacked because they believed computers would change the world. Their hacker ethic stood for freedom of information, freedom of access to computers, and freedom from bureaucracy.
	<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the opportunity to speak with Mr. David Seng of the University of Arizona about these early revolutionaries.<sup id="citationThree">3</sup> Mr. Seng is the professor of the &ldquo;Ethics in Hacking and Computer Science&rdquo; and studies these men and their ideologies at great length. &ldquo;[The MIT hackers] knew they were on the verge of something, but they didn't know what,&rdquo; Mr. Seng told me in our interview. &ldquo;I don't think they knew what kind of digital world they were actually creating.&rdquo;
	<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These early computers would hardly be recognized for what they were by today's standard. They filled entire rooms, cost millions of dollars, and could only handle the most primitive of calculations. Most importantly, these computers could not store any data; if they were ever turned off, everything was lost. &ldquo;Files&rdquo;, as we think of them, were series of magnetic or hole&ndash;punched tapes stored in drawers and cabinets. According to Mr. Seng, &ldquo;they didn't realize all of records, all of our medical records would be digital, all of financial records would be digital, everything.&rdquo; And, in order to spy and run successful surveillance, &ldquo;it all hinges on memory.&rdquo;
	These hackers, for all of the good they accomplished, needed a source to fund their projects. And that source was, unsurprisingly, the military. &ldquo;Even at MIT, it was all military [funding]. The hackers were all very ambivalent about that; 'This is all military funding, I don't know if I want to be working with these resources.' But the government had the resources, and the funds, and as soon as the memory got there, they were [spying].&rdquo;
	<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these hackers is Richard M. Stallman, creator of the GNU operating system and founder of the Free Software Foundation and the Free Software Movement.<sup id="citationFour">4</sup> He is often considered an extremest in his anti&ndash;authoritarian views, but also prophetic; many of his predictions about the malicious intents of groups such as Google and the NSA came true, despite being written years in advance. According to Stallman, a non&ndash;free program &ldquo;is an instrument giving somebody else power over the users&rdquo;. Stallman has made it clear through his entire career that by &ldquo;free&rdquo;  he is referring to freedom, not gratis or price.
	<br><br>
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="space"></div>
					<h1 id="knowledge" class="title text-center">Knowledge is <span>Money</span></h1>
					<div class="row">
						<p>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Stallman's campaign against</i> proprietary software has lead him to a great disdain for corporations and computer companies seeking profits at the expense of their users' privacy and security. At a privacy conference in Germany in December of 2014, he lambasted these companies, saying that &ldquo;nearly all users of proprietary software are being victimized by proprietary malware. Of course, the reason they [computer companies] do this is typically for profit. It's not that they're sadists who enjoy mistreating people; no, they're totally egoistical and they do this for profit. The more users they make captive, the more they can sell to somebody else.&rdquo;
	<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they do sell. A lot. Private information is most useful for companies for advertising, for which about $8 billion dollars are spent annually. And the effectiveness of advertising is directly related to knowledge of your target audience, down to specific information about individual customers. One advertising firm may have deals with dozens &mdash; if not hundreds &mdash; of separate websites, allowing them a view into a wide cross section of the internet's behavior. And if one person uses multiple of these sites, then advertisers are able to track that user across the pages uses technologies such as cookies and browser fingerprints. A search result for car prices on one website may lead to an increase in car dealership advertisements on completely unrelated websites. Likewise, a Facebook post or email about a new book may spark Amazon advertisements by the same author on seemingly disconnect news websites. Avi Goldfarb and Catherine E. Tucker, with the Association for Computation Machinery, did a study about the effectiveness of advertising before and after the instantiation of privacy laws in the EU limiting the tracking ability of companies across websites. The effectiveness of advertising, or the number of people who bought an item as a result of being exposed to an advertisement, dropped by 65%.<sup id="citationFive">5</sup> It is little wonder, then, that companies would fight for their right to track.
	<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When knowledge becomes money, corporations will do anything to gather as much of it as they can. Fortunately, consumers have the power to stop corporations in their tracks by declining privacy policies and end user licenses, or by boycotting products until they change. So why is it, then, that the &ldquo;I Agree&rdquo; button has been turned from the ultimate weapon in privacy management to the largest lie on the internet?
	<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporations know one thing about their consumers: they don't read. And they certainly won't read anything longer than a few paragraphs written in legalese. So by framing privacy policies as legal documents, filled with doublespeak phrases and technical jargon, they shift the protection off of customers and onto themselves. Today, most privacy policies are written to protect the corporations from legal responsibility, not the customers from privacy invasions.<sup id="citationSix">6</sup>
	<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporations have a few tricks up their sleeves to pull this legal slight-of-hand off. By adding time qualifications, such as &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; or &ldquo;occasionally&rdquo;, the threat of data sharing seems to diminish, when in reality these words are meaningless. And by obfuscating the cause for data sharing, or what all &ldquo;data sharing&rdquo; entails, they can make the possibility of shipping data en bulk to advertisers disappear right before customer's eyes. This grand illusion of protection is all too often bought into by customers eager to share their oh-so-important photos with their several hundred closest friends, unaware of the dangerous gambit they have taken.
	<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom does not disappear over night. It did not vanish into thin air in Germany, it did not evaporate in Russia, and it will not suddenly go away in America. Instead, it will be mortgaged off, piece by piece, to the highest bidders and to the imminent domain of the government. Perhaps it will be taken in the name of national security, and perhaps we will freely give it up in the name of a better user experience. Maybe our freedom is worth a finite amount, and maybe it would be wise to prefer cheap entertainment. But that isn't what I believe, and it's not what people like Richard Stallman or the MIT hackers would believe. Privacy, and with it anonymity, is the backbone of democracy and the surest foundation on which freedom can be established and preserved. Privacy is worth fighting for; but if people like Julian Assange of Wikileaks or Edward Snowden, who became famous after whistle blowing the NSA's Prism program, are to be believed, then we as a society have a long uphill battle ahead of us to restore the Internet to its original ideals. It is a fight worth fighting.
	<br><br>
	But today, it is a fight we are losing.
